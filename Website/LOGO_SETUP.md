# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Hashimi Logo

The website is configured to use your Hashimi logo. To complete the setup:

1. **Save your logo file** as `hashimi-logo.png` in the `assets/images/` folder
2. **Recommended logo dimensions**: 
   - Minimum: 100x100 pixels (for retina displays)
   - Optimal: 200x200 pixels or higher
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or white background
3. **Logo should include**:
   - The abstract graphic icon (blue and orange intertwined shapes)
   - The "hashimi" text in lowercase
   - The "Powered by Life" tagline

## Current Logo Configuration

The website is already configured to display:
- **Logo image**: `assets/images/hashimi-logo.png`
- **Brand name**: "hashimi" (lowercase, matching logo)
- **Tagline**: "Powered by Life" (matching logo)

## Color Scheme Matching Logo

The website color scheme matches your logo:
- **Deep Blue (#003D82)**: Used for primary text, brand name, tagline, navigation accents
- **Vibrant Orange (#FF6B35)**: Used for primary buttons, call-to-action elements, hover states
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Clean background matching logo background

## Logo Display Locations

Your logo appears in:
- Header navigation (all pages)
- Browser favicon/tab icon
- Footer (if you add it later)

## Testing

After adding your logo file:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Check that the logo displays correctly in the header
3. Verify the logo scales properly on mobile devices
4. Ensure the logo maintains aspect ratio and doesn't appear stretched

## Troubleshooting

If the logo doesn't appear:
- Check that the file is named exactly `hashimi-logo.png` (case-sensitive)
- Verify the file is in `assets/images/` folder
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Ensure the image file is not corrupted
